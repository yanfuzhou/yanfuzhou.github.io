# [](#header-1)Walk through the AWS LIDAR H3

The AWS LIDAR H3 is a tool for producing hexagonal DEM from [USGS 3DEP LiDAR Point Clouds (Open Data on AWS)](https://registry.opendata.aws/usgs-lidar/). The USGS 3DEP LiDAR Point Clouds are indexed as [entwine point tile (EPT)](https://entwine.io/entwine-point-tile.html). It  is a simple and flexible octree-based storage format for point cloud data. The AWS LIDAR H3 is built on top of three key libraries. They are [PDAL](https://pdal.io/), [GDAL](https://gdal.org/) and [H3](https://h3geo.org/), etc. Other libraries are [numpy](https://numpy.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), [shapely](https://shapely.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual.html) and [scipy](https://scipy.org/), etc.

## [](#header-2)Download
Please install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) before proceed, this is the prerequisite.  

For avoiding the headache of creating an essential complex development environment for locally run, the AWS LIDAR H3 tool is built into a docker image, and it was published in docker hub: [https://hub.docker.com/r/yzhou16/aws-lidar-h3](https://hub.docker.com/r/yzhou16/aws-lidar-h3)

Once you've installed docker locally, you can download the AWS LIDAR H3 tool as follow:

```bash
$ docker pull yzhou16/aws-lidar-h3
```

Then you can check its command options like below:

```bash
$ docker run --rm aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py -h
usage: aws-lidar-h3.py [-h] -b BOUNDS [BOUNDS ...]
                       [-usgs USGS_ENTWINE_BOUNDARIES_URL] [-s3 LIDAR_S3]

## [](#header-2)A tutorial
Let's take the Pentagon as our example.

The Pentagon is located in this bounding box area (the yellow retangular area on the google map):

![rgb-pentagon](../images/rgb_pentagon.png)

```text
# minimum longitude, minimum latitude, maximum longitude, maximum latitude
-77.060466, 38.866578, -77.051325, 38.874446
```

For getting the bounding box parameters, you can use [bboxfinder](http://bboxfinder.com/#0.000000,0.000000,0.000000,0.000000) to draw the bounding box and then get its parameters on the bottom left of the map

![rgb-pentagon](../images/bboxfinder.png)

After you get the bounding box parameters, now we can use the AWS LIDAR H3 tool to produce a hexagonal DEM inside that bounding box area. Beware that your bounding box area must be less than 2km<sup>2</sup>. This is because hexagonal interpolation is an expensive computation, it may consume a lot cpu and memory resources, and this is why I limited the size of data input. 

By default, the AWS LIDAR H3 can produce a hexagonal DEM at resolution 14, and each hexagon at resolution 14 has an area of approximately ~6.3m<sup>2</sup>. For a pixel grid whose area is 6.3m<sup>2</sup>, its edge length is ~2.509m (round off to integer is 3m). It's fortunate that the [1/9th Arc-second DEM](https://data.usgs.gov/datacatalog/data/USGS:40e52270-5c4b-497d-987f-827e374becff) is approximately 3m resolution. So we can compare our hexagonal DEM at resolution 14 with the 1/9th Arc-second DEM.

### [](#header-3)Data Structure

The AWS LIDAR H3 can produce a hexagonal DEM tiff image, which is a 64bit 2 bands raster file. You can use the [Value Tool Plugin](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/valuetool/) in [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/) to check each pixel values in those 2 bands. 1) Band 1 is `h3_int`, which is the integer representation of the h3 index; 2) Band 2 is the elevation and its unit is meters.

![value_tool](../images/value_tool.png)

For extracting the elevation band and put it into a single tiff image, you need to use GDAL command to reach this:

```bash
$ gdal_translate -b 2 input.tif output.tif
```
reference: [https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_translate.html](https://gdal.org/programs/gdal_translate.html)

### [](#header-3)Command Examples

For producing a hexagonal DEM at resolution 14 for the Pentagon bounding box area:

```bash
$ docker run --rm \
	-v ~/Desktop/output:/aws-lidar-h3/output aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py \
	-b -77.060466 38.866578 -77.051325 38.874446 \
	-i -f the_pentagon
```

Then extract the elevation band to a single image
```bash
$ gdal_translate -b 2 the_pentagon.h3.tif the_pentagon.h3.elevation.tif
```
This is the hexagonal DEM rendering. 3D rendering is generated by [Qgis2threejs](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Qgis2threejs/):

For producing a hexagonal DEM at resolution 14 and a 1/9th Arc-second DEM for the Pentagon bounding box area:

```bash
$ docker run --rm \
	-v ~/Desktop/output:/aws-lidar-h3/output aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py \
	-b -77.060466 38.866578 -77.051325 38.874446 \
	-n19 -i -f the_pentagon
```
This is the 1/9th Arc-second DEM rendering. 3D rendering is generated by [Qgis2threejs](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Qgis2threejs/):
![ned19_pentagon_view](../images/ned19_pentagon_view.png)

---
Sometimes for hydrology analysis, we prefer to use bare earth DEM with elevation get smoothed:

```bash
$ docker run --rm \
	-v ~/Desktop/output:/aws-lidar-h3/output aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py \
	-b -77.060466 38.866578 -77.051325 38.874446 \
	-be -n19 -s -i -f the_pentagon
```

Then extract the elevation band to a single image
```bash
$ gdal_translate -b 2 the_pentagon.bare_earth.h3.tif the_pentagon.bare_earth.h3.elevation.tif
```

On the left is the  hexagonal DEM, and on the right is the 1/9th Arc-second DEM, both of them are bare earth DEM:
![bare_earth_h3_ned19_pentagon](../images/bare_earth_h3_ned19_pentagon.png)

---
The AWS LIDAR H3 can also export the hexagonal DEM to a csv file. Either with a csv header or without a csv header

- export to csv with header

```bash
$ docker run --rm \
	-v ~/Desktop/output:/aws-lidar-h3/output aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py \
	-b -77.060466 38.866578 -77.051325 38.874446 \
	-c -f the_pentagon
```
- export to csv without header (for BigQuery ingestion)

```bash
$ docker run --rm \
	-v ~/Desktop/output:/aws-lidar-h3/output aws-lidar-h3 /aws-lidar-h3/aws-lidar-h3.py \
	-b -77.060466 38.866578 -77.051325 38.874446 \
	-f the_pentagon
```
